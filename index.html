          <p>Doomcrop is a game for 2+ players that can be played with a regular deck
            of playing cards. All that is required is enough table space to lay out
            around 20 cards.
            <br><br>

            Although luck is a component of play, sound strategy is a necessity.
            You must think of yourself as the commander of a ramshackle army,
            giving orders while a battle rages. Your number cards will engage your
            opponents in combat, while your face cards will use their courtly
            powers to influence the tides of war.
            <br><br>

            Your goal is capture your opponent's cards, while protecting your own
            cards from capture. Whosoever has captured the most cards by the time
            the Draw Pile runs out, wins!
        </p></div></div></div>

<!-- Game Setup -->
      <div id="game-setup" class="container"><h3>Game Setup</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <p>The standard 2-player Doomcrop game uses one deck of playing cards
            with the Jokers removed.
            <br><em>(Please see the Optional Rules section
            to play with more players, more decks, or more Jokers.)</em>
            <br><br>

            Shuffle the deck and deal 10 cards to each player, facedown.
            <br><br>

            Look at your cards arrange 9 of them into a 3-by-3 grid.
            <strong><u>You may look at your own facedown cards at any time.</u></strong>
            <br><br>

            Take the 10th card and start your Discard pile, face-up. It should be
            <u>separate</u> from your opponent's Discard pile. Cards in your Discard pile
            cannot return to play, so choose your 10th card carefully.
            <br><br>

            Place the rest of the shuffled deck facedown between players.
            This is the <em>shared</em> <strong>Draw pile.</strong>
            <br><br>

            Whichever player discarded the card with the lowest value goes first.
            For this, Face cards have a higher value than all Numbers, and Diamond
            Numbers are more valuable than equal Numbers that are non-Diamonds.
            In the case of a tie, flip a coin.</p></div></div>

          <h4>Turn Order</h4>
            <p>On your turn, choose a card in your grid to flip face-up. If it's a Number, you attack.
            If it's a Face card, you activate its ability. If you capture a card,
            put it in your Discard pile face-up and immediately replace it with a facedown card
            from the top of the Draw pile.
            <br><br>

            After all captured cards have been replaced, pass the turn to your opponent.

            <h4>Opposition</h4>
            <p>Each card in your grid has its opposite in your opponent's grid.
            To oppose each other, the two cards must be equally close to the Line of Opposition
            between the two grids, and they must be directly aligned with each other.
            Each card is the mirror of its opposite.
            <br><br>

            Most Number cards may only attack their Opposing card. Clubs Numbers
            have extended range (see below).

            <h4>Numerological Combat</h4>
            <p>Statistically speaking, the majority of the deck is Number cards.
              Think of them as your rank-and-file troops. All they know is combat.
               <br><br>

              Flip a Number card face-up to attack its Opposing card.
              If its Opposing card is facedown, flip it face-up as well. <br>
              <u>If the Opposing card is a Number and:</u></p>
            <ul>
              <li>you have the <u>higher</u> Number, you capture the Opposing card!</li>
              <li>you have the <u>lower</u> Number, the opponent captures your card.</li>
              <li>the numbers are <u>tied</u>, both cards remain face-up on the board.</li> </ul>
            <p>If the Opposing card is revealed to be a Face card, it may not use
              its special ability (unless it is turned facedown again by a Queen).
              <strong>Face cards can only be captured by <u>any Number 2</u>, or
              any Number whose <u>suit matches the Face card.</u></strong> A Face
              that is attacked by any other Number must remain on the
              board until it is captured by a capable Number or an Ace.
              <br><br>

              The Number 2 has another unique trait: <strong>it is the only Number that
              can capture a Number 10.</strong></p>

            <p>In the unlikely event that either player begins their turn with all of their
              own cards face-up, both players immediately capture all of their own cards,
              draw 9 cards from the Draw pile, and build their grid again facedown.</p>
            <h4>I Don't Have Any Good Moves?</h4>
            <p>Due to the randomness of a shuffled deck, this situation will occur
              from time to time. Look for a Spade you can sacrifice to refresh your grid.
              If you have to let your opponent capture a card of yours, try to
              avoid giving them a Diamond. If you have a King handy, the benefits you get from
              drawing several new cards may outweigh the points you give your opponent.</p>

          <h4>Playing with Multiple Decks</h4>
          <p>Doomcrop can be played with more than one deck of cards.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Players may shuffle multiple decks together to form the Draw pile.
            This is workable even if the decks' back-face art doesn't match.</li>
            <li>If players want their own individual Draw piles, these can be
            dealt out evenly from the shared Draw pile at the start of the game.</li>
            <li>Players may use multiple decks to form individual Draw piles, as
            long as each player has an equal amount of cards at the start of the
            game.</li></ul>

          <h4>Playing with 3+ Players</h4>
          <p><em>With more than 2 players, it is recommended to use multiple
          decks as outlined above.</em><br><br>

          When playing Doomcrop with 3 or more players, determining Opposing cards
          is more complicated. You now have multiple axii of opposition. With 3
          players, you have an axis on both sides of your grid. With 4 players,
          you also have the original top row axis. <br><br>

          With odd numbers of players, players may only attack the opponents
          directly to their left and right. With even numbers of players greater than 4,
          players may also attack the opponent directly opposite them.
          It is recommended that players amend this as a house rule if they wish
          to be able to skip players when attacking.</p>

          <h4>Playing with Jokers</h4>
          <p>Unlike other Face cards, the Joker can be captured by any Number card.<br><br>
          When you flip a Joker face-up, or when you capture a Joker,
          roll a 6-sided die and obey the table below.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Players swap sides of the board.</li>
            <li>Players swap Discard piles.</li>
            <li>Each player captures all of their own cards and deals a new 3-by-3 square.</li>
            <li>All face cards are activated, including face-up ones.</li>
            <li>Each player shuffles their own cards together and deals their 3-by-3 square randomly, facedown.</li>
            <li>For the rest of the game, play with the top card of the Draw pile face-up.</li></ol>

          <h4>Epic Techniques</h4>
          <p>If you want to add Epic Tech to your game, observe the following rules.
          Activate these techniques before you flip a card on your turn. The cards do
          not need to be face-up to activate these techniques.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If your grid contains 4 Hearts cards in a square, you may turn any
              amount of them facedown.</li>
            <li>If your grid contains 4 Diamonds cards in a square, you may flip
             any amount of their Opposing cards face-up. No other abilities are activated.</li>
            <li>If your grid contains 4 Spades cards in a square, you may capture any
            amount of them.</li>
            <li>If your grid contains 4 Clubs cards in a square, you may flip any amount
              of them face-up, and attack any cards they could normally attack.</li></ul>
