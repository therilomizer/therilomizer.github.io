        <div class="two-thirds column">
          <p>Doomcrop is a game for 2+ players that can be played with a regular deck
            of playing cards. All that is required is enough table space to lay out
            around 20 cards.
            <br><br>

            Although luck is a component of play, sound strategy is a necessity.
            You must think of yourself as the commander of a ramshackle army,
            giving orders while a battle rages. Your number cards will engage your
            opponents in combat, while your face cards will use their courtly
            powers to influence the tides of war.
            <br><br>

            Your goal is capture your opponent's cards, while protecting your own
            cards from capture. Whosoever has captured the most cards by the time
            the Draw Pile runs out, wins!
        </p></div></div></div>

<!-- Game Setup -->
      <div id="game-setup" class="container"><h3>Game Setup</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <p>The standard 2-player Doomcrop game uses one deck of playing cards
            with the Jokers removed.<br><em>(Please see the Optional Rules section
            to play with more players, more decks, or more Jokers.)</em>
            <br><br>

            Shuffle the deck and deal 10 cards to each player, facedown.
            <br><br>

            Look at your cards and choose one to discard. Arrange your remaining
            cards into a 3-by-3 grid. You may look at your own facedown cards at any time.
            <br><br>

            Take the 10th card and start your Discard pile, face-up. It should be
            <u>separate</u> from your opponent's Discard pile. Cards in your Discard pile
            cannot return to play, so choose your 10th card carefully.
            <br><br>

            Place the rest of the shuffled deck facedown between players.
            This is the <em>shared</em> <strong>Draw pile.</strong>
            <br><br>

            On your turn, flip one of your cards face-up. If it's a Number, you attack.
            If it's a Face card, you activate its ability. If you capture a card,
            put it in your Discard pile face-up and immediately replace it with a facedown card
            from the top of the Draw pile.
            <br><br>

            After all captured cards have been replaced, pass the turn to your opponent.

            Cards oppose each other if they have equivalent row height
            (front, middle, or back), and they are vertically aligned on your
            left, middle, or right.

                <br>

            <p>Flip a Number card face-up to attack its Opposing card.
              If the Opposing card is facedown, flip it face-up.

            <p>If it's a Face Card, it loses its chance to use its special ability.
              However, <strong>Face cards can only be captured by Numbers 2 or 10.</strong>
              If a Number between 3 to 9 attacks a Face, neither card is captured.
              Both cards remain face-up.</p>

          <h4>Playing with Multiple Decks</h4>
          <p>Doomcrop can be played with more than one deck of cards.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Players may shuffle multiple decks together to form the Draw pile.
            This is workable even if the decks' back-face art doesn't match.</li>
            <li>If players want their own individual Draw piles, these can be
            dealt out evenly from the shared Draw pile at the start of the game.</li>
            <li>Players may use multiple decks to form individual Draw piles, as
            long as each player has an equal amount of cards at the start of the
            game.</li></ul>
        </div></div>

        <div class="twelve columns">
          <h4>Playing with 3+ Players</h4>
          <p><em>With more than 2 players, it is recommended to use multiple
          decks as outlined above.</em><br><br>

          When playing Doomcrop with 3 or more players, determining Opposing cards
          is more complicated. You now have multiple axii of opposition. With 3
          players, you have an axis on both sides of your grid. With 4 players,
          you also have original top row axis. <br><br>

          With odd numbers of players, the official rule is that players may
          only attack their opponents directly to their left and right.
          With even numbers of players greater than 4, players may also attack
          the opponent directly opposite them. It is recommended that players
          amend this as a house rule if they wish to be able to skip players
          when attacking.</p>

          When you flip a Joker face-up, or when you capture a Joker,
          roll a 6-sided die and obey the table below.</p>

            <li>Players swap sides of the board.</li>
            <li>Players swap Discard piles.</li>

            <li>Each player shuffles their own cards together and deals their 3-by-3 square randomly, facedown.</li>
            <li>For the rest of the game, play with the top card of the Draw pile face-up.</li></ol>

            <li>If your grid contains 4 Hearts cards in a square, you may turn any
