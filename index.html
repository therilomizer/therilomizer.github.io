          <p>The standard 2-player Doomcrop game uses one deck of playing cards with the Jokers removed.
          <br><br>Shuffle the deck and deal each player 10 cards, facedown.
          <br><br>Look at your cards and choose one to discard. Arrange your remaining cards into a 3-by-3 square. You may look at your own facedown cards at any time.
          <br><br>Place the rest of the shuffled deck facedown between the players - this is the <em>shared</em> <strong>draw pile.</strong>
          <br><br>Take the card you discarded and place it face-up near you - this is your <em>individual</em> <strong>capture pile.</strong>
          <br><br>Your goal is to have the most cards in your capture pile by the time the draw pile is empty.

          <div class="two-thirds column">
            <p><strong>Capture</strong> -  When you capture a card, remove it from the board and place it in your capture pile, face-up. The player who now has an empty space on their board should immediately replace the captured card with a facedown card from the draw pile. Captured cards cannot interact with the board or leave the capture pile until they are counted out at the end of the game.
            <br><br><strong>Opposing Card</strong> - Every card on your side of the board has an opposing card under your opponent's control. Cards are opposed to each other if they are in the same column and the same row position (front, middle, back).

                <li>Swap the places of any two of your own facedown cards.</li>
                <li>Turn one of your face-up number cards facedown (face cards cannot be turned facedown).</li>

  <!-- Numbers Attack!
  ========================================= -->
      <div class="container"><h3>Numbers Attack!</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="twelve columns">
            <p>Statistically speaking, the deck will contain mostly number cards. When you flip a number card face-up, it activates an attack. When a number card attacks, compare its number value to the value of its opposing card (OC). If the OC is facedown, flip it face-up (this does not activate abilities).
            <ul>
              <li>If the OC has a lower number value than the attacking card (or if it's a tie), the OC is captured.</li>
              <li>If the OC has a higher number value than the attacking card, the OC defends itself and the attacking card is captured.</li>
              <li>If the OC is a face card, it is captured only if the attacking card is an 8, 9, or 10. If it's any other number, the turn ends without any card being captured. Do not turn any cards facedown. </li>
            </ul>
            <em>(Example: if you flip over a 6 of Diamonds on your top right corner, the opposing card is the opponent's top left corner (from their point of view). Let's say it's a 4 of Spades. You win the attack and capture the 4 of Spades)</em>

            <ul>
              <li>When you flip over a <strong>Jack</strong>, swap the positions of any of your cards, as many times as you like until satisfied. You may not turn any cards face-up or face-down during this process.</li>
              <li>When you flip over a <strong>Queen</strong>, turn any amount of your other cards facedown.</li>
              <li>When you flip over a <strong>King</strong>, flip all of your number cards face-up, then each of your number cards attacks its opposing card.</li>
              <li>When you flip over an <strong>Ace</strong>, instantly capture any card on the board (does not need to be face-up).</li>

            <br><br>In the event that capture piles are tied, or the players want to continue the game, shuffle your capture pile and your remaining cards together - this is now your individual draw pile. Deal yourself a new 3-by-3 square and continue playing until one capture pile runs out.
