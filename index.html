            <p>Greetings traveler! Doomcrop was designed by Riley Adamson.
              <br>That's me! I work as an Assistant Editor in Los Angeles, California.
              I contributed to such shows as <em>I Think You Should Leave</em> on Netflix,
              and <em>The Eric Andre Show</em> on Adult Swim. I made this website to
              practice frontend coding & graphic design, and to get my cool game idea out into the
              world. Feel free to DM me if you want to discuss the game or the site.
              Thanks for visiting!

          <p>Doomcrop is a game for 2+ players that can be played with a regular deck
            of playing cards. All that is required is enough table space to lay out
            around 20 cards.
            <br><br>

            Although luck is a component of play, sound strategy is a necessity.
            You must think of yourself as the commander of a ramshackle army,
            giving orders while a battle rages. Your number cards will engage your
            opponents in combat, while your face cards will use their courtly
            powers to influence the tides of war.
            <br><br>

            Your goal is capture your opponent's cards, while protecting your own
            cards from capture. Whosoever has captured the most cards by the time
            the Draw Pile runs out, wins!

        <div class="twelve columns">
          <p>The standard 2-player Doomcrop game uses one deck of playing cards
            with the Jokers removed.<br><br>

            Shuffle the deck and deal 10 cards to each player, facedown.
            <br><br>

            Look at your cards and choose one to discard. Arrange your remaining
            cards into a 3-by-3 grid. You may look at your own facedown cards at any time.
            <br><br>

            Take the card you discarded and place it face-up, separate from your
            opponent's face-up card. This is your <em>individual</em> <strong>Discard Pile.</strong>
            <br><br>

            Place the rest of the shuffled deck facedown between players.
            This is the <em>shared</em> <strong>Draw Pile.</strong>

              facedown card from the top of the Draw Pile.<br><br>

          <h4>Playing with Multiple Decks</h4>
          <p>Doomcrop can be played with more than one deck of cards.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Players may shuffle multiple decks together to form the Draw Pile.
            This is workable even if the decks' back-face art doesn't match.</li>
            <li>If players want their own individual Draw Piles, these can be
            dealt out evenly from the shared Draw Pile at the start of the game.</li>
            <li>Players may use multiple decks to form individual Draw Piles, as
            long as each player has an equal amount of cards at the start of the
            game.</li></ul>
        </div></div>
        <div class='row'>
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <h4>Playing with 3+ Players</h4>
          <p><em>With more than 2 players, it is recommended to use multiple
          decks as outlined above.</em><br><br>

          When playing Doomcrop with 3 or more players, determining Opposing Cards
          is more complicated. You now have multiple axii of opposition. With 3
          players, you have an axis on both sides of your grid. With 4 players,
          you also have original top row axis. <br><br>

          With odd numbers of players, the official rule is that players may
          only attack their opponents directly to their left and right.
          With even numbers of players greater than 4, players may also attack
          the opponent directly opposite them. It is recommended that players
          amend this as a house rule if they wish to be able to skip players
          when attacking.</p>

          <h4>Playing with Jokers</h4>
          <p>Unlike the other face cards, the Joker can be captured by any number card.<br><br>
          When you flip a Joker face-up, or when you capture a Joker,
          roll a 6-sided die and obey the table below.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Players swap sides of the board.</li>
            <li>Players swap Discard Piles.</li>

            <li>Each player shuffles their own cards together and deals their 3-by-3 square randomly, facedown.</li>
            <li>For the rest of the game, play with the top card of the draw pile face-up.</li></ol>
