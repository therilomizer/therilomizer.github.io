          <p>It's harvest time in the ancient city. But something horrible has
            happened to the crop. Whoever eats it... changes. Their bodies show nothing,
            and they retain their intelligence. It's their souls that get twisted.
            Workers turn against thier families. New alliances fracture the old.
            Now, at the outset of civil war, you must lead a coalition of the
            doomed. Deploy your followers. With strategy and luck, gain control
            of the city. Your doom is nigh - march out and face it!

          <p>The standard 2-player Doomcrop game uses one deck of playing cards
            with the Jokers removed.<br><br>

            Shuffle the deck and deal 10 cards to each player, facedown.<br><br>

            Look at your cards and choose one to discard. Arrange your remaining
            cards into a 3-by-3 grid. You may look at your own facedown cards at any time.<br><br>

            Take the card you discarded and place it face-up, separate from your
            opponent's face-up card. This is your <em>individual</em> <strong>Capture Pile.</strong><br><br>

            Place the rest of the shuffled deck facedown between players.
            This is the <em>shared</em> <strong>Draw Pile.</strong>
